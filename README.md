# A MobiFi NFT: The Alex Hunter

## Park and Earn
MobiFi offers a gamification feature to its customers. Every-time an indoor parking service is used a customer earns reward points named greenz. The ability to earn more greenz is directly related to the NFT character a customer holds. As a starting point for the game, MobiFi offers a Free NFT character to its customers named Free Alex Hunter. For every EUR is spent on an indoor parking service a customer earns one greenz. 

## Accelerate Earnings
MobiFi also offers paid NFTs who have special skills, and allow customers to accelerate greez earnings.      

## Smart Contracts for the Alex Hunter
There are two smart-contracts which have been deployed into the Mumbai Polygon network. 
The first one (i.e. FreeHunterAlexV4.sol) is referred to the Free Alex, and it facilitates the minting process and the permission to allow a MobiFi user to mint the character. The minting process can only be executed via the MobiFi mobile app for users who have successfully completed the registration process. 
The second smart-contract (i.e PaidHunterAlexV1.sol), facilitates the process of minting NFT who have special skills, and they allow customers to earn more greenz for each parking transaction.
